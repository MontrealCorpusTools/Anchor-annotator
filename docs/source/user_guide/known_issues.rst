   As Anchor is in alpha, it is also possible to get into unrecoverable states due to database corruption and not all edge cases are handled by Anchor yet.  I recommend installing `pgAdmin <https://www.pgadmin.org/>`_ so that you delete/drop databases as necessary for corpora.  Once a corpus database is dropped, then restarting Anchor will trigger loading it from scratch (if the "Autoload last used corpus" option is enabled in :ref:`general_options`)
